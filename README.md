# REAL ESTATE PRICE PREDICTION AND RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

This real estate data science  project focused on leveraging data science techniques to extract insights, predictions, and recommendations within the real estate domain. Key stages included:

1. **Data Gathering:** Scraping real estate data from 99acres and other sources to ensure a diverse dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Merging:** Meticulous cleaning and merging of data to ensure consistency and completeness.

3. **Feature Engineering:** Introducing new features to enrich the dataset, such as room indicators, possession age, and a luxury score.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducting thorough univariate and multivariate analyses to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.

5. **Model Selection & Productionalization:** Comparing various regression models including Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting to predict property prices. Deployment of the selected model via Streamlit, creating a user-friendly web interface.

The project showcased proficiency in data scraping, cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, model selection, and deployment using Streamlit. Through comprehensive evaluation, the most suitable regression model was identified for predicting property prices, demonstrating adeptness in model selection and evaluation techniques.
